# Color-Correction
Implementation of color correction in matlab for both RGB and Grayscale images.

# For Grayscale Images
This source code is the implmentation of Local Color Correction using Non-Linear Masking published by Nathan Moroney Hewlett-Packard Laboratories,  Palo Alto, California.

In this method, a local color correction operation is performed that is based on non-linear masking. The operation is very fast and does not require any manual adjustments.
